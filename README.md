# CPP_Objects_As_Arguements
The objects of a class can be passed as arguments to member functions as well as non-member functions either by value or references.
When an object is passed by value a copy of the actual object is created inside the function.This copy is destroyed when the function terminates.
In pass by reference, only a reference to that object (not the entire object) is passed to the function.
